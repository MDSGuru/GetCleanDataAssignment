Codebook for data contained in CleanTotalMeans.txt

SubjectID - Unique ID number for the group of 30 volunteers wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist
          - Originally contained in two subject_train.txt files (one for test, one for training), appended to features
            and activity data for each, then stacked to account for all 30 subjects
ActivityID - Unique ID number of the 6 activities captured
           - Originally contained in two Y_*.txt files (one for test, one for training), appended to features and subject
             data for each, then stacked
Activity - Activity label for each of the 6 activity ID's (1 through 6 inclusive) as follows:
         	1 WALKING
	 	2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		4 SITTING
	 	5 STANDING
		6 LAYING
         - Contained in a single file and merged into the fully stacked subject, features and activityID files
         
The following features variables were originally contained in two X_*.txt files (one for test, one for training)
Those NOT containing the text strings "mean()" or "std()" were omitted
These were appended to the subject and activity data for each and stacked
The labels were then stripped of the unnecessary "()" 
Then the MEAN was calculated for each of these BY the unique SubjectID and ActivityID groupings
The MEANS are what are contained in the final file
